      <subsection name="Introduction">
      <p>
        JIntellitype is a Java API for interacting with Microsoft Intellitype 
        commands as well as registering for Global Hotkeys in your Java application.  
        The API is a Java JNI library that uses a C++ DLL to do all the communication
        with Windows.   <strong>NOTE:</strong> This library ONLY works on Windows.  If
		you are looking for a Linux version please see <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jxgrabkey/">JxGrabKey</a> project on Sourceforge.

      <subsection name="Hotkeys">
        <p>
          Have you ever wanted to have CTRL+SHIFT+G maximize your Swing application 
          on the desktop? Even if that application did not have focus?  Well, now you can! By
          registering a Windows Hotkey combination, your application will be alerted 
          when the combination you select is pressed anywhere in Windows.  Windows has the
          API call <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/userinput/keyboardinput/keyboardinputreference/keyboardinputfunctions/registerhotkey.asp">RegisterHotKey</a>
          for registering a global hotkey combination so that your app receives that message
          no matter what else you are doing or even if your application has focus.  This is
          a commonly requested feature in Java that has now been implemented by JIntellitype.
          
          Check out the <a href="quick-start.html">Quick Start Guide</a> for an example on how to use JIntellitype.

        <p>
          Have you ever wanted your Java application to react to those special Play, Pause, 
          Stop keys on some newer keyboards like Winamp and Windows Media Player do?  Ever wonder how they do it? 
          If you want your application to "listen" for those special keys, now you can with JIntellitype!  
          Just register an IntellitypeListener and you will be notified when those messages are received.   
          To read more about these special commands see the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/userinput/keyboardinput/keyboardinputreference/keyboardinputmessages/wm_appcommand.asp">MSDN Documentation</a>
          about the Intellitype commands.
